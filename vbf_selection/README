ntuple*.root: the current starting point, ntuple generated from a raw AOD
    |
    |- extract*.py: iterate through ntuple and strip out only events we care about
    |
    |
    V
inputs*.p: a list of events, which are each a list of jets, which are a list of jet parameters
    |
    |- jet_selector.py: strips all events down to only two jets
    |
    |
    V
processed_inputs*.p: identical to inputs*.p, each jet has additional information (for now just a true/false on whether we think its a VBF jet)
    |
    |- vbf_tagger.py: use jet inputs (and possibly more) to distinguish VBF signal events from background (ggF for now)
    |
    |
    V
outputs*.p: a list of confidences, one per event, stating how likely the event is to be a VBF event
    |
    |- evaluate_performance.py: just make a roc curve with the background and signal outputs
    |
    |
    V
performance.pdf: probably just a ROC curve of performance
